# AnkommenPlus

A modular, open-source platform designed to support the integration journey of diaspora communities in Germany.

## Overview

AnkommenPlus addresses the fragmented integration process by providing four key modules in one cohesive platform:
- **Practical Language Learning** for German and heritage languages
- **Professional Networking & Mentorship Hub**
- **Cultural Navigation Guide** for German bureaucracy
- **Community Space** for social connection and support

## Why AnkommenPlus?

Existing integration solutions are often:
- Fragmented across different platforms
- Not built by/for the communities they serve
- Lacking cultural specificity
- Closed-source and not adaptable

Our platform is:
- **Community-driven**: Built with and for diaspora communities
- **Modular**: Different communities can customize features
- **Open-source**: Transparent and community-contributed
- **Holistic**: Addressing all aspects of integration

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Docker containers
- **Architecture**: Modular microservices

## Current Status

*This project is currently in development as part of a Prototype Fund application. We expect to begin implementation in mid-2026.*
